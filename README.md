# Markdown judge

A very simple judge that takes the input, and renders it as Markdown.

## What can I do with this?

This judge can be useful if you want text (natural language) answers from students.

## Which Markdown flavour is supported?

The judge doesn't actually render anything, so see the [Dodona documentation](https://docs.dodona.be/nl/references/exercise-description/#markdown).
